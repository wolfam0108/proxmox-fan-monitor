Hardware Context
Motherboard: Huananzhi H12D-8D
Super I/O Chip: ITE IT8613E
OS: Linux (Proxmox / Debian)
Problem
The default Linux kernel it87 driver does not detect the IT8613E chip automatically. The command modprobe it87 force_id=0x8613 failed with "No such device".



Solution: Out-of-Tree Driver
We installed the updated driver maintained by Frank Crawford, which has better support for ITE chips with ACPI conflicts.

1. Installation Steps
installed build dependencies:

apt update
apt install -y git build-essential dkms pve-headers-$(uname -r)
Cloned and installed the driver:

git clone https://github.com/frankcrawford/it87.git
cd it87
make
make install
2. Configuration (Crucial Step)
The driver requires the ignore_resource_conflict=1 parameter to bypass ACPI resource reservations common on these motherboards.

Loading the module:

modprobe it87 ignore_resource_conflict=1

/etc/default/grub
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet acpi_enforce_resources=lax"
